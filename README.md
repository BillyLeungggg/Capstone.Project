# Capstone.Project


The project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating visualizations, and developing a content-based product recommendation system for Citi977. The goal is to identify product trends, price distributions, and recommend products based on product information 

Swivt Technologies aims to develop a content-based product recommendation system for Citi977.com.np. Interns will use their data analysis, and machine learning skills to gather and process the data, perform EDA to gain insights, create visualizations, and build a recommendation system.  The final deliverable will include a comprehensive report, visualizations using tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, and a Streamlit application to present the recommendation system.
